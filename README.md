# Deterministic Analysis of Swedish Electricity Supply for its Internal Market
A comprehensive university project about Swedish electricity supply for its internal market using R.

# Project Overview
This repository showcases a university project that I made. The study investigates **potential deterministic models for understanding changes in Swedish internal electricity supply and demand over time**, using statistical time-series methods in R.

- **Objective**: To find deterministic models that explain the Swedish electricity supply well.
- **One Key Finding**: Identified a potential cause for a structural break in the time-series.
- **Deliverable**: A full professional analysis paper (available as a PDF in this repo).

# Tech Stack & Methodology
- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `lmtest`, `strucchange`, `skedastic`
- **Tools**: RStudio, MS Excel (Initial Data Preparation)
- **Statistical Techniques**: Linear Regression, Chow test, Contrast coding, Non-linear transformations, ICs, STL decomposition, Autocorrelation, ...
